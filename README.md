# Statistical-Forecasting-Project
Statistical forecasting of gasoline sales with SARIMA and regression models.
## Data
The data file contains quarterly gasoline and diesel sales (in 1000 m3) of a major distributor between 2000-2006, and a number of potential independent variables.
These variables are summarized as follows:\
UGS: Unleaded gasoline sale in a given quarter,\
DGS: Diesel gasoline sale in a given quarter,\
RNUV: An index indicating the rate of new unleaded gasoline using vehicles being added
to the traffic in a quarter,\
PU: Average price (adjusted with an index) of a liter of unleaded gasoline in a quarter,\
PG: Average price (adjusted with an index) of a liter of diesel gasoline in a quarter,\
NUGV: Number of unleaded gasoline using vehicles in the traffic,\
NDGV: Number of diesel gasoline using vehicles in the traffic (per 1000 people),\
GNPA: Agriculture component of Gross National Product (adjusted with an index),\
GNPC: Commerce component of Gross National Product (adjusted with an index),\
GNP: Grand total for GNP (agriculture, commerce and other components total).\

## Aim
Our task is to forecast the sales (for two products) for every quarter of 2007
by using two methods:\
Method A: Forecasting with time series analysis,\
Method B: Forecasting with regression.
